# About Me

This is my personal page. I'll write about my life, hobbies, and interests here.

I'm a recent EEE graduate, working full time as a Software Engineer in Defence R&D.
I like to read, listen to music (classical and jazz are my favourite genres) and learn.

I'm interested in many fields, some of my friends tell me that I'm too interested in many things 
from Embedded Systems, Computer Vision, Machine Learning to Robotics, Mathematics and Smart Systems.
